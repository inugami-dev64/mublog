<h1>Pseudoscience as a new religion</h1>

<p>Ever since the so called Covid-19 pandemic, it has become more and more apparent that the absence of religion
from mainstream society causes the general populus to find alternative paths for defining their morales. Whenever
some ridiculously extreme measure is taken for the sake of &ldquo;public safety&rdquo;, it seems that there is almost always
some community of people defending these dystopian measures and it certainly seems as a result that the society
becomes even more polarised due to that.</p>

<p>Once there is enough ignorant people that blindly believe in anything that the scientific establishment presents them, it
becomes surprisingly easy for science institutions and mainstream media to present lies to them, without facing any serious
consequences, assuming that all pseudoscience critisisers would be either socially or physically exterminated. This onto itself
creates a whole new level of religion for those that believe in the current establishment and its prosperous future. They become
increasingly aware of the fact, how the so called dissidents are being exterminated and if they can present themselves as being
supporters of the regime, they might expect some kind on prosperity for their own benefit. This prosperity for them is extremely
unlikely to happen, because the establishment would only see these kinds of people as useful idiots, since society as a whole is
very large and finding someone to blame for ones problems is surpisingly easy task to do. This task can be given to those useful
idiots to keep them busy, while never actually presenting these people any kind of prosperity that they were once promised with.
Let&rsquo;s assume that the problem of handling dissidents becomes a non-issue in this fictional society. In this case the establishment
can just launch another clever propaganda campain to transform its followers into believing some other non-existing issue to keep
useful idiots busy, while keeping the majority support for themselves.</p>

<h2>Implicit indoctrination from the example of Covid-19 timeline</h2>

<p>In the times of stability and prosperity, it becomes quite difficult to differentiate potentially indoctrinateable people from
those whose moral values are nothing more than a current mainstream trend. In order to separate people and create strong
polarisation in society an artificially inflated crisis can be used for that purpose perfectly. This kind of polarisation helps
the new religion to separate infidels from believers and create this kind of strong morale on both sides to fight against each
other. Now, in order for this new social polarisation and the creation of the religion to be successful a mass
indoctrination campain needs to be launched targeting mainly people, whose moral values are nothing more than a current mainstream
trend, since these kinds of people are usually the easiest followers to gain. The successful indoctrination process of pseudoscience from
the example of Covid-19 timeline is explained below.</p>

<h3>Artificially inflated unsolveable problem</h3>

<p>Artificially inflated large-scale problem in this case is the Sars-Cov2 virus itself, but in reality any kind of virus would be a good
choice for this step. This problem could not only be a healthcare related problem, but also literally any other problem that can be
derived from the consequences of the current human civilisation. For example the climate change, income inequality, sexual minority
rights, racial minority rights, migrant rights, etc. Whichever issue seems to fit the narrative of the current ruling elite is picked.</p>

<p>Once the correct issue is picked, a massive campaign of inflated hysteria needs to be created around the issue. The inflated hysteria is
generally generated by using media as a tool for propaganda. Once enough people have been brainwashed into believing the lies of the
establishment it becomes increasingly easy for the establishment to restrict peoples&rsquo; freedoms. Taking the examples of Covid-19 timeline
these freedoms would be freedom of movement, freedom of health and freedom of speech. Restrictions of freedom of movement are excused due
to the spread of some &ldquo;dangerous virus&rdquo;. Restriction of freedom of health is excused with silly arguments such as &ldquo;unvaccinated are to blame
for the spread of virus, thus we must create an apartheidic regime to punish these bastards&rdquo; or something similar. Restriction of freedom
of speech is excused by &ldquo;the need to stop misinformation&rdquo;. All of these aformentioned reasons should be evaluated critically by individuals
to see the reasonability behind these decisions, but as it turns out high trust societies especially tend to more easily trust the
establishment blindly.</p>

<h3>Solution and pseudosolution</h3>

<p>The next step this massive indocrination is to create either a pseudosolution or a real solution that is contriversial enough to polarise
the society as a whole. Pseudosolution can be any kind of plausible enough attempt to combat the current issue, that in reality does
absolutely nothing to achieve the solution. This means that the so-called solution needs to be able to create kinds of people that strongly
support it and people who strongly oppose it. If the solution itself is not sufficient to create a large scale social conflict, some
additional measures can be taken to achieve that. For example giving supporters some sort of centralised benefits, and opposers some sort
of additional punishment for their corresponding world views.</p>

<h3>Absolute crackdown of any oppositional civil unrests</h3>

<p>Once the opposition is completely angered out, major unrests can be expected. The unrests will always be discredited publicly and
sometimes even crackdowned violently. This can result even more serious civil unrests and even more sharp conflicts between oppositioners
and establishment supporters.</p>

<p><img src="/videos/netherlands.webm" alt="Covid-19 riots in the Netherlands are another examples of sharp conflicts between oppositioners and the establishment" /></p>

<p>This kind of crackdown creates more confidence among the establishment supporters, which onto itself allows for even larger control
for the establishment. However once the opposition dies, the personal freedoms of each person will also be jeopardised.</p>

<h3>Fully centralised cult-like establishment</h3>

<p>The final endgame of this indoctrination is to establish a fully centralised control of each individual&rsquo;s life, thus making any kind of
resistance against this new religion nearly impossible. The ones that show even slight signs of resistance against the establishment
will be persecuted or dropped-out from the new-world society. The new establishment will serve as an implicit dictatorship, telling people
exactly what they can and cannot do in a cult-like manner. Human rights will be artifacts from the old world and they will be quietly
forgotten en masse.</p>
